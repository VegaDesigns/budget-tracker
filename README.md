## üß† Development Journey

### Phase 1: MVP Build

**What Went Wrong:**

- Balance calculation was incorrect  
- Users had to type negative values manually  

**Fixes:**  
- Updated storage logic to save expenses as negatives  
- Corrected the math for balance/income/expenses  
- Added a dropdown to select Income vs. Expense

### Phase 2: UI/UX + Visual Feedback  
**Goal:** Make it feel like a modern, professional product.

**What Went Wrong:**  
- Charts duplicated on each update  
- Dark mode didn‚Äôt persist  
- Layout and spacing were inconsistent  

**Fixes:**  
- Destroyed existing Chart before re-render  
- Saved theme in localStorage  
- Redesigned layout with Flexbox and uniform spacing

### Phase 3: Functional Features
**Goal:** Add all interactive features and clean up the code.

**What Went Wrong:**  
- Inline edits weren‚Äôt styled  
- Budget bar didn‚Äôt always refresh

**Fixes:**
